# turn_based_card_game
I made this within a week just for fun, planning onto doing this on a javaFX application just to play it with mouse instead of texting numbers.


this is a mana cost, turn-based, two-player game. each turn, players gain mana equal to the current turn number. players must spend their mana wisely, balancing luck and strategy in drawing cards. each cost has five rarities: bad, bad-mid, mid, mid-good, and good, listed in ascending order. players have nine spots for cards, which fall into two classes: spells and creatures. spells are magical effects that cannot physically attack or be attacked. in contrast, creatures have health points and can deal and receive damage.
